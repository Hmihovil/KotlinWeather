# WeatherApp

This is a simple Weather application for Android that I am currently developing in Kotlin. I started to this by following the course "Android O & Java - Mobile App Development | Beginning to End" on Udemy and I took it to the next level and make it something completely different. It uses GPS to determine the device's location and retrieves the 5 days forecast data accordingly from the "openweathermap.org" API service. Soon I will add select city option which will allow user to get the forecast for selected city. I am using android-async-http to make http request as well as parse the JSON. Here you can find loopj/android-async-http github repository: "https://github.com/loopj/android-async-http".

In order to build this project, you will need to apply for your own api key from "http://openweathermap.org/appid". A basic plan is free. Once you obtain your API key add the following attribute to your "gradle.properties" file using this format.

API_KEY = "your api key goes here"

Then you should be able to use it without a problem.
